Supreme Court ruling on “Reasoning part” and “Operative part” of a Cooperative Society resolution,https://www.kaanoon.com/487134/supreme-court-ruling-on-reasoning-part-and-operative-part-of-a-cooperative-society-resolution,"Supreme Court ruling on “Reasoning part” and “Operative part” of a Cooperative Society resolution

I am seeking guidance on a legal issue concerning a Cooperative Society in Punjab.

In this case, a Cooperative Society passed a resolution stating that:

“There have been objections from time to time that the society’s working is not functional. Apart from one member (let’s call him Alpha) who did not pay the full amount and therefore did not receive a plot, all other members who paid the money have been given their plots. As most of the work of the society is complete, to make the society functional again, it is resolved to look for more suitable land.”

Now, another member (Bravo), who had paid the full amount but never received his allotment letter because he failed to provide ID proof and other required documents, claims that this resolution confirms his allotment as a member who paid full amount.

However, the society’s stand is that the above resolution did not operate as an allotment order — the statement that “all members who paid have been given plots” was only part of the reasoning, not the operative portion of the resolution. The operative part, according to the society, was only to make the society functional again by looking for new land.

I seek help from learned members to identify Supreme Court or High Court rulings that clarify the legal distinction between:

The reasoning part (recitals) and

The operative part (decision portion)
of a resolution — particularly where only the operative part creates enforceable rights or obligations.

Any citation or guidance on interpretation of resolutions distinguishing between the recital/reasoning and the operative/decision portions would be greatly appreciated."
